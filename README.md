# dsh-TUI

`dsh-TUI` is an interactive terminal front door for DeepSeek Harness. It is
mounted as a Cordis plugin and provides a Claude Code-style conversation, tool,
session, and fullscreen terminal experience while continuing to use the
official DSH agent, model, tool, session, and persistence services.

The project does not patch DeepSeek Harness core. Installing the plugin enables
the interface, and removing it leaves no core modifications behind.

> Status: public beta. It is suitable for daily use and extension work. Read
> [Architecture and limitations](docs/architecture.md) before relying on its
> permission model or terminal-specific behavior.

## Highlights

- **Terminal-native interaction**: streaming Markdown, structured tool cards,
  command and file completion, `@` file references (complete anywhere in the
  message; sending attaches the file content or directory listing), history
  search, message selection, and inline or alternate-screen rendering.
- **Visible agent state**: live activity, segmented context usage, TPS, cache
  hit rate, reasoning effort, input/output tokens, and Git/session metadata.
- **Complete session workflow**: `/resume`, `/new`, `/compact`, `/export`, the
  `/btw` side question, model switching, and double-`Esc` rewind through a
  session fork.
- **Official DSH integrations**: agent presets, skills, MCP, goals, todos,
  subagents, and `ask_user_question` are connected through existing services
  and registries.
- **Designed for long sessions**: event-driven projection, differential output,
  message virtualization, replay coalescing, and bounded caches prevent render
  cost and memory from growing without limit.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: an interactive terminal TTY, the official `dsh` CLI, and
`pnpm` 10+. Model requests also require `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

```sh
# 1. Install the CLI and this plugin globally (ships the dsh-tui command)
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui

# 2. Start it (first run auto-initializes the dsh-tui profile; needs pnpm)
dsh-tui
```

Manual alternative: `dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui`
(the repository's `sh install.sh` wraps this step and checks the required
commands), then `dsh-tui` and `dsh --profile dsh-tui` are equivalent.

`dsh-tui --resume` restores the most recently selected session; on Windows
the repository's `dsh-tui.cmd` works the same way.

See [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) for profile composition,
source builds, and troubleshooting.

Inside the TUI, `/update` updates the installed
`@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui` package and automatically restarts into the current session.

The TUI also checks npm for updates in the background after startup. The check
never blocks the first frame and silently ignores offline or registry errors.

For migration from the former `dsh-cc-tui` package and `cc-tui` profile, see
[Getting started](docs/getting-started.md#migrate-from-the-former-package).

## How It Works

```text
dsh profile
  -> dsh-base
  -> dsh-TUI Cordis patch
  -> agent preset + DSH services
  -> session/event
  -> Channel projection
  -> React components
  -> ported Ink/Yoga renderer
  -> terminal
```

The TUI owns interaction and presentation only. The session log remains the
conversation source of truth, while model calls, tool execution, fork/resume,
compaction, and persistence remain owned by DSH services. See the
[architecture guide](docs/architecture.md) for module boundaries and
performance details.

## Development

CI uses Node 24 and pnpm 11. The package supports Node `^22.19 || >=24`.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm smoke
```

`pnpm build` compiles `src/` into the checked-in `lib/types/` output. Source
changes must include regenerated artifacts, and rendering, questionnaire, or
tool-card changes require the relevant regression scripts.

## Permissions and Security Boundary

`dsh-TUI` does not implement a separate sandbox. It uses the filesystem,
shell, sandbox, and approval policies of the active DSH profile. The supplied
profile uses workspace confinement and approvals by default on non-Windows
platforms. Windows currently has no corresponding sandbox backend, so the
composition falls back to `danger-full-access` without approval prompts.
Inspect the profile before starting it around sensitive credentials or an
untrusted repository.

See [Permissions and security boundary](docs/architecture.md#permissions-and-security-boundary)
for details.
